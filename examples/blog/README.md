# About
This is an escript that uses epers (and the code in ./src) to implement a blog.

It uses different repositories (mysql, mongo, redis) just as an example and
to make a point about how easy it is to switch or mix different databases.

# Tour
Start by taking a rough look at **./run**, and then **src/blog.erl**.

# How to run
    ./run
